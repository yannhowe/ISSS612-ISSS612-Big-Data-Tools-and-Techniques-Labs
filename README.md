=========================

Lab documentation for SMU MITB course ISSS612.

Intro
=========================

This lab focuses on setting up the environment required to process Twitter tweets in real time. This will consist of an Elastic Map Reduce cluster on Amazon Web Services, a way to connect to the cluster for administration called SSH which requires a key pair to keep it secure. You will access the notebooks and code on your cluster via a modern web browser like Chrome.

You will need an AWS account to complete the lab.
